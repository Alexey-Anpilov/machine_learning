Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/ gas 8. Line your largest baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the rice flour into a large bowl, season, then toss the chicken wings in the flour. Make sure theyâ€™re well coated, then spread evenly across the baking tray. Bake for 20 mins (or 15 mins in an air-fryer) until starting to brown.
While the chicken cooks, make the glaze. Put the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sugar and 150ml water in a small pan on a medium heat. Cook for 4-5 mins until bubbling and slightly thickened, then take out 2 tbsp and mix with the cornflour. Pour the cornflour mixture back into the glaze, whisking all the time, and cook for 3 mins until thickened. Squeeze in the lime juice.
Once the chicken has been cooking for 20 mins, brush over most of the teriyaki glaze and return to the oven for another 20 mins, (or air-fryer for 10 mins) basting once more during cooking.
Remove from the oven, top with a final brush of the glaze, then sprinkle with the lime zest, spring onions and chilli. Serve with fluffy rice and pak choi, if you like.
