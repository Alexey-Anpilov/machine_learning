To make the sauce, tip the cornflour into a bowl and whisk in the lemon zest and juice until any lumps disappear. Add the honey, soy, sesame seeds and sesame oil and mix again. Set aside.
Combine the cornflour, flour, baking powder, ¼ tsp salt, the pepper, beaten egg and 4 tbsp water in a large bowl. Tip in the chicken pieces, gently tossing to coat.
Heat the vegetable oil over a high heat and fry the battered chicken pieces in batches for 6 mins per batch until golden and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken and transfer to a plate or tray lined with kitchen paper.
When all the chicken has been cooked, return all of it to the pan, still over a high heat, pour in the sauce and toss to coat – the sauce will thicken and cling to the chicken. Scatter with the spring onions and serve with noodles, if you like.
